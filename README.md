Have you ever had trouble deciding on a password?

Well problem solved this is a random password generator.Over all it was an exercise in learning the fundamentals of Javascript. I did manage to learn quite a bit but I can't take full credit for this code. I had a ton of help from my tutor who diligently guided me through the nuances of Javascript. Such as Math.floor(Math.random) which is the heart of this code. Without the ability to generate random numbers a random password would be out of reach.

That being said there is at least one weakness I never did manage to get an alert working to stop the process if you type in something other then a number. If any one finds an answer to that problem I'd love to hear it.
